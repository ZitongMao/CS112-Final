# Civil Conflicts Prediction
Civil wars are increasingly prevalent and lethal, providing an important threat to human security. Various studies have been done to research the relationship between social factors and the onsets of civil conflicts. However, as pointed out by Ward et al. (2010), "too little attention has been paid to finding variables that improve our ability to predict civil wars." Achieving statistically significant results does not necessarily increase the predictive power of existing models. In this paper, I will start with a replication of Ward et al.'s findings. Then, focusing on Ward et al.'s problem of using the original data set as both the training and test set, I will implement a k-fold Cross Validation to predict out-of-sample results. Finally, I will construct a Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART) model and a Random Forest model to increase the predictive power of the models without changing the independent variables. I will end the paper with discussions as a decision memo for current researchers.
